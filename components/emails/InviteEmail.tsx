            There is lots of great work being done by the multitude of groups
            working to make a positive difference in the areas of the
            environment and civil society. However, there wasn't a single place
            to go that showed all the organisations and how they are connected.
            These webs, in the first instance, are therefore a tool to help
            potential volunteers to discover organisations such as yours.
            Additionally, we want to facilitate collaboration across
            organisations as much as possible.

            We hope you are excited to be a part of the Resilience Web, and that
            you will share it with members of your organisation! If you have any
            questions about the web, or if you would rather not be included on
            it, please let us know by replying to this email. If you have any
            feedback, we would also be very happy to hear it.
